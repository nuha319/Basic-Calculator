 This is a simple command-line calculator built using Python. As it can be seen, it supports basic artihmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

 The features are as follows:
a) Takes two numeric inputs from the user
b) Handles invalid inputs using try-except
c) Prevents division by zero
d) Loops continuously until the user exits
e) Beginner-friendly Python code

The project was developed in Google Colab and later uploaded to Github.
